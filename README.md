A copy protection, licensing software written in C++ for Windows and Linux (with a simple C api for use in C projects).

It allows to protect the software you develop from unauthorized copies,
limit the usage in time, to a specific set of machines, or prevent the usage in 
virtualized environments. It is an Open License Manager that helps to keep your 
software closed :smirk: . A comprehensive [list of features](https://github.com/open-license-manager/open-license-manager/wiki/features), and their status is available in the project wiki.

## License
The project is donated to the community. It comes with a very large freedom of use for everyone, and it will always be. 
It uses a [BSD 3 clauses](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) licensing schema, that allows free modification and inclusion in commercial software. 


## Project Structure
The software is made by 2 main sub-components:
 * a C++ library with a nice C api, `licensecc` with minimal (or no) external dependencies (the part you have to integrate in your software).
 * a license generator open-license-manager `olm` that allows you to generate a license.
 
these modules are planned....
 * a license [backoffice](../../issues/7) in php (in order to handle multiple licenses).
 * a license debugger to be sent to the final customer when there are licensing problems. 
 * a [log descriptor](../../issues/8) in order to decrypt logs generated by the license system.

# How to build

Below an overview of the basic build procedure, you can find detailed instructions for each [supported environment](https://github.com/open-license-manager/open-license-manager/wiki/Build-the-library) in the wiki. 

## prerequisites
 * compilsers: GCC (Linux) MINGW (Linux cross compile for Windows), MINGW or MSVC (Windows) 
 * tools/libs: cmake, boost. If target is linux openssl is necessary.

```
git clone https://github.com/open-license-manager/open-license-manager.git
cd open-license-manager/
mkdir build
cd build
```

## on Linux
```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install
make
make install
```

## on Windows (with MSVC 2015)
```
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" -DBOOST_ROOT="{Folder where boost is}" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install
cmake --build . --target install --config Release
```

## cross compile with MINGW on Linux
```
x86_64-w64-mingw32.static-cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install
make
make install
```

How to test
===========

## on Linux
```
make test
```

## on Windows (MSVC)
```
ctest -C Release
```

How to use
==========

This simple example shows how to integrate open-licence-manager into your project

```
$ cd example
$ cmake .
$ make
$ ./example
license ERROR :
    license file not found
the pc signature is :
    Jaaa-aaaa-MG9F-ZhBB
$ ../install/bin/license_generator example -s Jaaa-aaaa-MG9F-ZhBB -o example.lic 
$ ./example
licence OK
```
